## 🚀 Features

- **Login** and **Sign Up** form toggle  
- Basic **form validation** (checks for empty fields)  
- **Responsive design** for mobile, tablet, and desktop  
- Circular container with red glow and background image

- ## 📝 How It Works

1. **Toggle Logic**:  
   - Clicking the link switches between login and sign-up forms.  
2. **Validation**:  
   - On submit, JavaScript checks that no field is empty and shows an alert if so.  
3. **Responsive Styling**:  
   - Media queries adjust container size, typography, and layout at different breakpoints.
  
   - ## 🚀 Getting Started
